# Acknowledgement
This is entirely made possible by @dauledk's material-timestamp-adapter project. Thank you to him for putting in the real work.

# Setup
This project lets you pick a date with Material Date Picker, saves it to Firestore, and loads it back from the server.
In order to try out this demonstration you will need to create your own Firebase project:
- After creating your Firebase project, go to Project Overview -> Settings -> "Add Firebase to your web app" 
- Copy the configuration to your clipboard
- Paste it into the `environment.ts` file in this project.
- You can now start the project with `ng serve` to test it out.
